## What is a LED?

**Light Emitting Diode (LED)** is a device that produces light in electrical and electronic circuits.  
It is a light sensor which emits light that is reflected from surfaces and helps in sensing the environment.

## How does a LED blink?

There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit:

- A relay  
- A transistor  
- An inverter (a logic NOT-gate)  
- PWM
